Cookie Disclaimer Remover
=========================

All websites display the UK and EU visitors this -f*cking- annoying popups and banners about using cookies like it was something new/bad. It's annoying as hell, it takes up my screen, it requires me to aim at the close button/icon to get rid of a message I have never ever wanted in the first place. This userscript automatically kills all (well, that's a brave assumption) those annoying messages.


Installation
------------

If you are new to this, please see [The Userscript Instalation Manual][1].

To get the script, just click here: [cookieInfo.user.js -- Cookie Disclaimer Remover][2]
